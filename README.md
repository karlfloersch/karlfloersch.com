# karlfloersch.com (v2.0)
## Discontinued - Moved to Quick Blog
I rethought this project and I'm instead going to build my new blogging site on Node.js and React.js. The new project is entitled [Quick Blog](https://github.com/karlfloersch/quick-blog). Quick Blog will be really cool, so go check it out!

## Goals
Build a search-centric blogging application. This site will make it easy to both produce and consume content. It will do this by focusing on two aspects above all else:

  1. If you want to write a blog post, the CMS should stay out of your way. That means logging in is a breeze, when writing you see your changes instantly, and posting and editing is one click away.
  2. Searching for content should be fast and painless. That means instant search results that show up **as you type**. These results should be exactly what you are looking for and should include highlights of the text you are searching.

## Design
To achieve these goals, I'll be using ElasticSearch for a powerful searching tool, and a powerful text editor (TBD). All these will be built on Django for it's code seperation and the cleanliness of Python.

## Maintenance
Active development will begin shortly and end with an update to the README.md. After that period is over, and version 2.0 of karlfloersch.com is release, I will stop development for as long as it takes for me to get inspired to do another total makeover of my personal webpage.

That being said, if you do use this code in any way and you run accross an issue, let me know and I'll do my best to help out.
